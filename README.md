An example showing how to use the hardware UART on the MSP430G2553 to transmit and receive characters between a terminal on the computer and the MSP430G2553 launchpad over the USB connection. Moreover, you will find in this code example a push button and timer interrupt modules. 

In this example sending an ‘R’ or ‘G’ will turn the red and green LEDs on and sending an ‘r’ or ‘g’ will turn them off, respectively. To send and receive characters over the serial port you can download any serial terminal application in your PC, like ZOC terminal, realterm...etc
